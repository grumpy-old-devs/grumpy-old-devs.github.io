<h1>Grumpy Old Devs</h1>

<p>Welcome to Grumpy Old Devs, where experience isn't just a buzzword – it's a lifestyle. Our team of seasoned
    developers, all proudly over 50, brings a treasure trove of knowledge accumulated over decades of coding, debugging,
    and eye-rolling at the latest industry fads. If you're looking for flashy, untested trends, you've come to the wrong
    place.</p>
<p>At Grumpy Old Devs, we know what works and what doesn't – because we've seen it all. We've survived the rise and fall
    of countless technologies, and we're still here, building systems that are as solid as our coffee. Our approach is
    simple: get the job done right, without the nonsense. No endless meetings, no confusing jargon – just
    straightforward, reliable software development.</p>
<p>We might be grumpy, but that just means we have zero tolerance for poor management and pointless fluff. Our
    development process is streamlined, effective, and surprisingly efficient for a bunch of so-called "dinosaurs." We
    believe in clear communication, steady progress, and a collaborative approach that keeps everyone in the loop –
    minus the hand-holding.</p>
<p>Grumpy Old Devs is not just a consultancy; it's a rebellion against mediocrity. We tackle modern software development
    challenges with tried-and-true methods, honed over years of hard-earned experience. So, if you want your project
    built right the first time, trust the experts who have been there, done that, and have the grey hair to prove it.
    Welcome to Grumpy Old Devs – where old school meets new solutions, with a side of sarcasm.</p>
